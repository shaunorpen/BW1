# BW1
Lambda School: Build Week 1

# Installation
- Run "npm install"
- Run "npm run ls"

# Things to do
- Check out the site on desktop, tablet and mobile devices. It's responsive so should look good at all screen sizes and orientations.
- Visit the FAQ page. Notice how you can expand and collapse each FAQ section.
- Click "Search". This should take you to a mocked up search results page.
- Click "Signup" and "Login". These should display modal windows inviting you to either sign up or log in.
- Click "Login" on the Login modal. This should take you to a mocked up user profile page.

# Notes
- This site was developed with HTML and CSS with a little JavaScript.
- Not all functionality works. Notably search, sign up and log in are missing.
